<h2> Little Projects!</h2>

This repository is full of little oddball projects we've made over the years that do... things! Some of them were built to solve puzzles, some of them were made to back up jokes, a few of them are just little time-savers or ways to check something. And none of them is really enough on their own to constitute a whole project, although some of them here or there ended up taking a lot longer to work out than expected, those are the best learning opportunities!

**Contents:**
- _Number Word &lt;cough&gt;_: Containing two useable functions, this script builds up a list of words that can be made with number/letter exchanges (like EGOIST/360157). Mainly used to work playful jokes into embedded numbers, like costs, bills, things like that.
